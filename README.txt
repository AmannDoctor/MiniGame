 Welcome to the Dungeon Finder!

Make sure to have the files properly set up for this game to work
---------------------------------

Both the Item.txt and Room.txt files should be outside along with the .idea, out, and src folder to properly function.
The Item.txt file is needed to insert the necessary items, since it holds the item IDs, item names, and item descriptions.
The Rooms.txt file is needed to insert the rooms, since it contains the room ID, name, description, exits, item and connections.
